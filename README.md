## Usage

The usage consist of starting [the systray applet](#the-systray-applet) and enabling [the systemd timer](#the-systemd-timer).

### The systray applet

To start the systray applet, launch the "Arch-Update Systray Applet" application from your app menu.

To start it automatically at boot, you can either:

- Run the following command (preferred method for most Desktop Environments, uses [XDG Autostart](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Autostart)):

```bash
arch-update --tray --enable
```

- Enable the associated systemd service (in case your Desktop Environment doesn't support [XDG Autostart](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Autostart)):

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now arch-update-tray.service
```

If you use a Window Manager or a Wayland Compositor, you can add the `arch-update --tray` command to your "auto-start" apps in your configuration file instead.

**If the systray applet doesn't start at boot regardless**, please read [this chapter](#the-systray-applet-does-not-start-at-boot).

The systray icon will automatically change depending on the current state of your system ('up to date' or 'updates available'). When clicked, it launches `arch-update` via the [arch-update.desktop](https://github.com/Antiz96/arch-update/blob/main/res/desktop/arch-update.desktop) file.

The systray applet attempts to read the `arch-update.desktop` file at the below paths and in the following order:

- `$XDG_DATA_HOME/applications/arch-update.desktop`
- `$HOME/.local/share/applications/arch-update.desktop`
- `$XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications/arch-update.desktop`
- `/usr/local/share/applications/arch-update.desktop` <-- Default installation path when installing Arch-Update [from source](#from-source)
- `/usr/share/applications/arch-update.desktop` <-- Default installation path when installing Arch-Update [from the AUR](#AUR)

In case you want (or need) to customize the `arch-update.desktop` file, copy it in a path that has a higher priority than the default installation path and modify it there (to ensure that your custom `arch-update.desktop` file supersedes the default one and that your modifications are not being overwritten on updates).

This can be useful to force `Arch-Update` to launch with a specific terminal emulator when clicking the systray applet for instance.  
**If clicking the systray applet does nothing**, please read [this chapter](#force-the-desktop-file-to-run-with-a-specific-terminal-emulator).

### The systemd timer

There is a systemd service (in `/usr/lib/systemd/user/arch-update.service` or in `/usr/local/lib/systemd/user/arch-update.service` if you installed `Arch-Update` [from source](#from-source)) that executes the `check` function when started (see the [Documentation](#documentation) chapter).  
To start it automatically **at boot and then once every hour**, enable the associated systemd timer (you can modify the auto-check cycle to your liking, see the [Tips and tricks - Modify the auto-check cycle](#modify-the-auto-check-cycle) chapter):

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now arch-update.timer
```

### Screenshots

Once started, the systray applet appears in the systray area of your panel.  
It is the icon at the right of the 'wifi' one in the screenshot below:

![systray-icon](https://github.com/Antiz96/arch-update/assets/53110319/fe032e68-3582-470a-9e6d-b51a9ea8c1ba)

With [the system timer](#the-systemd-timer) enabled, `Arch-Update` automatically checks for updates at boot and then once every hour. The check can be manually triggered by running the `arch-update --check` command or by right-clicking the systray icon and then clicking on the `Check for updates` menu entry:

![check_for_updates](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86c3107d-d7aa-4ced-b9aa-69668c2e3c2a)

If there are new available updates, the systray icon will show a red circle and a desktop notification indicating the number of available updates will be sent (requires [libnotify](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/libnotify/ "libnotify package") and a running notification server):

![notif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55301470-fab6-463f-af2e-ebe4e3d65af7)

You can then see the list of available updates in the systray icon's tooltip by hovering your mouse over it:

![tooltip](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52ee0608-a8a2-4be9-ba9b-badeb8720ba1)

Alternatively, you can see the list of available updates in the dropdown menu entry by right-clicking the systray icon:

![dropdown_menu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4621d7d2-a9e4-40c3-851f-ee1687e6cf1e)

When the systray icon is left-clicked, it prints the list of packages available for updates inside a terminal window and asks for the user's confirmation to proceed with the installation (it can also be launched by running the `arch-update` command, requires [paru](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/paru "paru"), [yay](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay "yay") or [pikaur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pikaur "pikaur") for AUR packages support and [flatpak](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/flatpak/) for Flatpak packages support).

![listing_packages](https://github.com/Antiz96/arch-update/assets/53110319/ed552414-0dff-4cff-84d2-6ff13340259d)

By default, if at least one Arch Linux news has been published since the last run, `Arch-Update` will offer you to read the latest Arch Linux news directly from your terminal window.  
The news published since the last run are tagged as `[NEW]`:

![listing_news](https://github.com/Antiz96/arch-update/assets/53110319/ec4032f3-835e-418c-b19a-b7bd089d6bd9)

When recent news get listed, you can select the news to read (e.g. 1 3 5), select 0 to read them all or press "enter" to proceed with update.  
If no news has been published since the last run, `Arch-Update` will directly proceed to the update after you gave your confirmation.

In both cases, from there, you just have to let `Arch-Update` guide you through the various steps required for a complete and proper update of your system! :smile:

Certain options can be enabled, disabled or modified via the `arch-update.conf` configuration file. See the [arch-update.conf documentation chapter](#arch-update-configuration-file) for more details.

```

For more information, see the arch-update(1) man page.  
Certain options can be enabled, disabled or modified via the arch-update.conf configuration file, see the arch-update.conf(5) man page.

### arch-update configuration file

```text
The arch-update.conf file is an optional configuration file for arch-update to enable, disable
or modify certain options within the script.

This configuration file has to be located in "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/arch-update/arch-update.conf"
or "${HOME}/.config/arch-update/arch-update.conf".
A default / example configuration file can be generated by running: `arch-update --gen-config`

The supported options are:

- NoColor # Do not colorize output.
- NoVersion # Do not show versions changes for packages when listing pending updates (including when using the `-l / --list` option).
- NewsNum=[Num] # Number of Arch news to display before updating and with the `-n / --news` option (see the arch-update(1) man page for more details). Defaults to 5.
- AURHelper=[AUR Helper] # AUR helper to be used for AUR packages support. Valid values are `paru`, `yay` or `pikaur`. If this option is not set, Arch-Update will use the first available AUR helper in the following order: `paru` then `yay` then `pikaur` (in case none of them is installed, Arch-Update will not take AUR packages into account).
- PrivilegeElevationCommand=[Cmd] # Command to be used for privilege elevation. Valid values are `sudo`, `doas` or `run0`. If this option is not set, Arch-Update will use the first available command in the following order: `sudo`, `doas` then `run0`.
- KeepOldPackages=[Num] # Number of old packages' versions to keep in pacman's cache. Defaults to 3.
- KeepUninstalledPackages=[Num] # Number of uninstalled packages' versions to keep in pacman's cache. Defaults to 0.
- DiffProg=[Editor] # Editor to use to visualize / edit differences during the pacnew files processing. Defaults to the `$DIFFPROG` environment variable's value (or `vimdiff` if `$DIFFPROG` isn't set). Note that, due to the lack of option to preserve environment variable in `doas`, this option will be ignored when using `doas` as the privilege elevation method.
- TrayIconStyle=[Style / Color] # Style to be used for the systray applet icon. Valid values are the available style / color variants for the icon set, listed in https://github.com/Antiz96/arch-update/tree/main/res/icons. Defaults to "light".

Options are case sensitive, so capital letters have to be respected.
```

For more information, see the arch-update.conf(5) man page.

## Tips and tricks

### AUR support

Arch-Update supports AUR packages if **paru**, **yay** or **pikaur** is installed:  
See <https://github.com/morganamilo/paru> and <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/paru>  
See <https://github.com/Jguer/yay> and <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay>  
See <https://github.com/actionless/pikaur> and <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pikaur>

### Flatpak support

Arch-Update supports Flatpak packages if **flatpak** is installed:  
See <https://www.flatpak.org/> and <https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/flatpak/>

### Desktop notifications support  

Arch-Update supports desktop notifications when performing the `--check` function if **libnotify** is installed (and a notification server is running):  
See <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_notifications>

### The systray applet does not start at boot

Make sure you followed instructions of [this chapter](#the-systray-applet).

If the systray applet doesn't start regardless, this could be the result of a [race condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software).  
In such case, it might be useful to slightly delay the startup of the systray applet by using a `sleep` statement beforehand:

- If you used `arch-update --tray --enable`, modify the `Exec=` line in the `arch-update-tray.desktop` file (which is under `~/.config/autostart/` by default), like so:

> Exec=sh -c "sleep 3 && arch-update --tray"

- If you used the `arch-update-tray.service` systemd service, run `systemctl --user edit --full arch-update-tray.service` and modify the `ExecStart=` line, like so:

> ExecStart=sh -c "sleep 3 && arch-update --tray"

- If you're using a standalone Window Manager or a Wayland Compositor, add a `sleep` statement before the `arch-update --tray` command in your "auto-start" apps in your configuration file, like so:

> `sleep 3 && arch-update --tray`

If the systray applet still does not start at boot, try to gradually increase the value of the `sleep`.

### Modify the auto-check cycle

If you enabled the [systemd.timer](#the-systemd-timer), the `--check` option is automatically launched at boot and then once per hour.

If you want to change the check cycle, run `systemctl --user edit --full arch-update.timer` and modify the `OnUnitActiveSec` value to your liking.  
For instance, if you want `Arch-Update` to check for new updates every 10 minutes instead:

```text
[...]
[Timer]
OnStartupSec=15
OnUnitActiveSec=10m
[...]
```

Time units are `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `h` for hours, `d` for days...  
See <https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.time.html#Parsing%20Time%20Spans> for more details.

In case you want `Arch-Update` to check for new updates only once at boot, you can simply delete the `OnUnitActiveSec` line completely.

### Force the desktop file to run with a specific terminal emulator

`gio` (which is used to launch the `arch-update.desktop` file when the systray applet is clicked) currently supports a [limited list of terminal emulators](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/main/gio/gdesktopappinfo.c#L2694).  
If you don't have any of these terminal emulators installed on your system, you might face an issue where clicking the systray applet [does nothing](https://github.com/Antiz96/arch-update/issues/162) and reports the following error: `[...] Unable to find terminal required for application`.

While waiting for Gnome to implement a way to allow people using their terminal emulator of choice with `gio` (which will hopefully [happen at some point](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/specifications/-/merge_requests/3)), you can workaround this issue by copying the `arch-update.desktop` file to `$HOME/.local/share/applications/arch-update.desktop` (for instance, see [this chapter](#the-systray-applet) for more details) and modifying the `Exec` line in it to "force" `arch-update` to run with your terminal emulator of choice.  
For instance, with [alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) *(check your terminal emulator's manual to find the correct option to use)*:

```text
[...]
Exec=alacritty -e arch-update
```

Alternatively, you can create a symlink for your terminal emulator that points to `/usr/bin/xterm`, which is the fallback option for `gio` (for instance, with [alacritty](https://alacritty.org): `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/alacritty /usr/bin/xterm`) or you can simply install one of the terminal emulators [supported](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/main/gio/gdesktopappinfo.c#L2701) by `gio`.
